Health Tracker
==============

Functionality
-------------

Use the search bar to search for any food or drinks or that you would like. A list of search results will appear in the search results 
section. Each search result contains the name of the food, the brand, and the number of calories per serving. By clicking the add button, the food item will be added to the selected foods section. In this section, the number of food items you have added will be counted, and total calories of the food items will be tracked.

To use the app, you can clone this repository and launch the index.html file.

API Reference
-------------

All food data that is retrieved using the search feature is retrieved from the [Nutriotionix API](https://developer.nutritionix.com/docs/v1_1).
